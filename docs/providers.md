# Providers

Synara does not host models or sell a separate model subscription. It operates supported
coding-agent runtimes installed and authenticated on your machine, then presents them through one
consistent workspace.

## Supported providers

| Provider                                                                | What Synara connects to                                      |

| [Pi](https://www.trysynara.com/docs/providers/pi)                       | Pi and the model providers configured through it             |
| [Factory Droid](https://www.trysynara.com/docs/providers/factory-droid) | Your installed and authenticated Droid runtime               |

Provider availability can differ between the current stable release and development builds. Use the
provider settings in your installed Synara version as the authoritative list for that build.

## What Synara manages

Synara provides the shared operating surface around each provider:

- Project and task ownership
- Provider and model selection
- Conversation and tool activity
- Approvals and user-input requests
- Terminal, browser, file, and diff surfaces
- Git environments and checkpoints
- Session continuation where supported
- Provider handoffs
- Usage information where the provider exposes it

## What remains provider-owned

The provider still controls:

- Installation
- Authentication
- Account and subscription limits
- Model availability
- Tool behavior
- Permission semantics
- Service availability
- Provider-specific session features

A provider working in its own terminal is an important prerequisite, but not a guarantee that every
provider feature is supported through Synara.

## Connect a provider

1. **Install the official runtime.** Use the provider's official installation instructions.
2. **Authenticate outside Synara.** Complete the provider's normal sign-in or credential setup.
   Verify the runtime from a fresh terminal.
3. **Open Synara provider settings.** Confirm that the provider is detected and enabled. When
   necessary, configure a custom path to the provider executable.
4. **Check model discovery.** Open the model picker and confirm that the expected models and options
   appear. Synara discovers many provider capabilities at runtime; the result can depend on the
   installed CLI version, account, subscription, and provider configuration.
5. **Start a small test task.** Use a harmless objective in a test repository before relying on a
   newly configured provider for important work.

## Models and effort options

Providers expose different selection models:

- A fixed catalog
- A catalog discovered from the installed runtime
- User-configured custom models
- Reasoning, effort, mode, or variant options
- Account-dependent availability

Synara normalizes these choices into the composer where possible without pretending that every
provider has identical capabilities.

Favorite models can be surfaced above larger catalogs, and supported provider executables can be
pointed at custom binary locations.

## Provider sessions

Each task owns a provider session.

The session may preserve provider-specific behavior such as:

- Plans
- Tool calls
- Approvals
- Reasoning summaries
- Context usage
- Model changes
- Resume or reconnect behavior
- Provider-native subagents or workflows

Capabilities vary. Do not assume a control available for one provider exists for all of them.

## Switching providers

A [provider handoff](https://www.trysynara.com/docs/workflows/handoffs) allows another provider to
continue the task and work in the same environment with the context Synara passes to it.

Use handoffs deliberately. Review the working tree before and after changing providers so ownership
remains clear.

## When a provider is missing

Check these in order:

1. Does the executable run from a fresh terminal?
2. Is the provider authenticated?
3. Is the expected executable on `PATH`?
4. Is a custom binary path configured incorrectly?
5. Does the installed runtime version support the required integration?
6. Does restarting Synara refresh the provider status?
7. Does the provider itself report a service or account error?

Continue with the [troubleshooting hub](https://www.trysynara.com/docs/troubleshooting) when the
runtime works independently but remains unavailable in Synara.

Use the dedicated [provider guides](https://www.trysynara.com/docs/providers) for exact
installation, authentication, verification, capabilities, update paths, and provider-specific
failure checks.
