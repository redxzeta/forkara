 * The marker is written *ahead* of the first migration statement, so its
 * presence proves an attempt started — not that the database is half-written.
 * Re-running is safe because the resume path never takes a second backup and
 * never rewrites the marker's backup pointer: if the retry fails, the original
 * snapshot and the manual restore command are still exactly where they were.
 * The bound is what keeps a deterministic failure from re-running migrations on
