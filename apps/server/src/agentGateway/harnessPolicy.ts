They are the canonical and complete control surface for that browser: do not load or use a generic Browser, Chrome, Computer Use, OS-automation, Node REPL, Playwright, or other browser-control skill/tool instead. They control only the exact Electron WebView the user sees, including its live DOM, cookies, and session. When no assigned tab exists, start with browser_open rather than browser_navigate. Take a fresh semantic browser_snapshot before element actions and after navigation or human interaction, requesting an image only when semantics are insufficient.",

Use browser_logs only for page diagnosis, browser_screenshot only when pixels matter, and browser_back, browser_forward, browser_reload, browser_hover, browser_drag, browser_select, or browser_upload when those actions express the intent directly. browser_upload accepts workspace-relative paths only; never invent or expose absolute host paths.",

If an action reports BrowserDownloadApprovalRequired, the download was safely cancelled before writing a file: explain that explicit user approval is required and do not retry it. If browser_click reports an OAuth popup requiring human action, leave the visible popup to the user, stop browser actions, and ask them to finish sign-in before continuing. If the turn is stopped or an abort is reported, issue no further browser action. As soon as the requested outcome is observed, stop using tools and answer the user; do not keep polling or continue browsing beyond the task.",
