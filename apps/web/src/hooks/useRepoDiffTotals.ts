// FILE: useRepoDiffTotals.ts
// Purpose: Resolve the working-tree diff totals (+additions / -deletions) for the
//          currently selected repo diff scope. Shared by the chat-header diff toggle
//          badge and the Environment panel "Changes" row so both read the same numbers.
// Layer: Chat git data hook
