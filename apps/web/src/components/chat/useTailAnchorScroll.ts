// FILE: useTailAnchorScroll.ts
// Purpose: Slide a just-sent user message to the top of the transcript viewport
//          and own the scroll until that slide settles.
// Layer: Chat transcript behavior hook
// Why: The space that lets the message anchor at the top while the response
//      streams below it is reserved natively by LegendList's `anchoredEndSpace`
//      (configured in MessagesTimeline), which keeps the reserve in sync with
//      measured row sizes inside the list's own layout pass. This hook performs
//      the one visible motion — moving the sent message to its anchored
//      coordinate — as a single frame loop that re-reads that coordinate every
//      frame. Re-targeting is what keeps the motion glitch-free: the anchor's
//      position moves while the slide is in flight (the end-space reserve grows,
//      rows above settle from estimated to measured heights, pre-turn status rows
//      land), and a fixed-target native smooth scroll would land wrong and then
//      need a visible correction. While the loop runs, the shared flag pauses
//      ChatView's auto-follow re-snaps so the motion has a single scroll owner.
//      After the anchor first lands, corrections snap instead of easing, so the
//      message is rigidly held rather than drifting back into place.
