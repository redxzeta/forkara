// FILE: chatHotPath.compiler.test.ts
// Purpose: Regression guard — the chat hot-path modules must stay fully
//          compilable by React Compiler. The compiler runs with the default
//          `panicThreshold`, so a bailout is silent: the module keeps
//          rendering but loses *all* auto-memoization. Everything listed below
//          renders (or gates) a message row, a sidebar row, or a keystroke, so a
//          silent bailout here costs whole-tree re-renders while typing.
//
//          Four triggers have actually shipped in this repo, all of them cheap to
//          avoid once known:
//            1. a default value inside a parameter destructuring pattern
//               (BuildHIR AssignmentPattern) — apply defaults in the body;
//            2. a ref-typed prop read off a `props` object (`ref={props.itemRef}`),
//               which spreads the ref verdict to every later `props.x` read —
//               destructure the props instead;
//            3. any value block (`??`, `&&`, `?.`, a ternary, a conditional
//               spread) or a `throw` inside a `try` — hoist it out, or move the
//               whole block to module scope;
//            4. a hand-written `useCallback`/`useMemo` dependency list the
//               compiler cannot match to its own inferred scope — drop the manual
//               memoization and let the compiler own it.
// Layer: Web build-integrity test
// Depends on: babel-plugin-react-compiler (same plugin the Vite build uses).
