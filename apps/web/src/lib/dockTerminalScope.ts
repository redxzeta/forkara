// Purpose: Derive a stable, isolated terminal scope id for right-dock terminals.
// Layer: Terminal scope helpers
// Exports: dock terminal scope prefix + id factory shared by the dock pane and cleanup.

// They reuse the per-thread terminal store/runtime keyed by this synthetic scope so
// xterm instances never collide with the host thread's drawer terminals.
